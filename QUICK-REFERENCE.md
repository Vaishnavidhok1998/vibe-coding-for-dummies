# ⚡ Vibe Coding Quick Reference

A cheat sheet for when you need to remember something fast.

---

## 🎯 The Core Philosophy

**If you can explain what you want, you can build it.**

Describe behavior, not code. Let the tools handle the syntax.

---

## 🛠️ The Stack

1. **Firebase Studio** — Backend, auth, database, hosting
2. **GitHub** — Source of truth, version control
3. **Cursor** — AI-powered code editor

**All free to start.**

---

## 🔄 The Workflow

1. **Start in Firebase Studio** — Get backend/auth/database set up
2. **Publish/Sync** — Firebase Studio creates your GitHub repo automatically
3. **Move to Cursor** — Clone the repo, build fast with AI
4. **Sync back to Firebase Studio** — Deploy and ship

**Build it. Commit it. Deploy it. Repeat.**

**Note:** Firebase Studio creates your GitHub repo for you when you publish/sync. Keep repos private. Don't commit secret keys.

## 💬 How to Talk to Cursor

### Good Prompts ✅

- "I want users to be able to log in and save notes"
- "When a user clicks delete, remove the note from Firebase"
- "Show all of the user's notes when they log in"

### Bad Prompts ❌

- "Write code for authentication"
- "Create a function that..."
- "Make it better"

**Describe behavior, not code.**

---

## 🎨 Picking Your First Idea

**The rule:** If it takes more than 1 sentence to explain, it's too big.

**Examples:**
- Note saver
- Daily checklist
- Idea tracker
- Resource bookmarker

**Start stupid simple. Make it work. Then make it better.**

---

## 🚀 Shipping Checklist

- [ ] Core features work
- [ ] Users can accomplish the main goal
- [ ] Deployed to Firebase Hosting
- [ ] Live URL works
- [ ] Share it

**Shipping ≠ Perfect. Shipping = Usable.**

---

## 🔧 Quick Fixes

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Firebase not defined | Check SDK is loaded |
| Permission denied | Update Firestore rules |
| Auth not working | Enable Email/Password in Firebase Console |
| Build errors | Test locally first |
| Cursor code doesn't work | Be more specific in prompt |

---

## 💰 Monetization Ideas

- SaaS (subscription)
- Micro tools (small, focused)
- Paid communities
- APIs
- Internal business tools

**Solve a real problem. Charge for it.**

---

## 📝 The 30-Day Goal

**Idea → Deployed App → First Customers in ~30 days**

- Week 1: Build core feature
- Week 2: Test and improve
- Week 3: Add monetization
- Week 4: Launch and get customers

**Speed beats perfection.**

---

## 🎯 When You're Stuck

1. Read the error message
2. Check the browser console
3. Ask Cursor to debug it
4. Simplify until it works
5. Ask the [community](https://www.skool.com/vibe-coding-with-chris-7196)

**Most bugs are simple. You just need to find them.**

## 💡 Remember

- Your first version is supposed to be bad
- Shipping beats perfect
- Speed matters more than perfection
- Real feedback > assumptions
- Build daily, not perfectly

**Vibe coding is about momentum, not perfection.**
